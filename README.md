#### App Service
This app was built to help the fledgling space travel industry connect rocket owners with potential customers.
Each user can view the current flight schedule and request space aboard that vessel. The space available is split between
the number of seats on the flight, and the cargo space available for transit. Users can also be sellers on the platform, offering their
inventory for sale.
